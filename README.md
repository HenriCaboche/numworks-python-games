Two minimalist Python games for the NumWorks calculator — FlappyDot and DodgeDot.

# 🕹️ NumWorks Mini Games

This repository contains two extremely minimal Python games made for the **NumWorks** calculator:

- **FlappyDot** – a basic Flappy Bird clone  
- **DodgeDot** – a simple falling-object dodging game

These games were created just for fun and run entirely on the NumWorks calculator's Python app.

## 🎮 Games

### 1. FlappyDot

A minimalist version of *Flappy Bird*. Press a button to make your dot jump and avoid hitting the ground or ceiling.

- Controls: Use the OK button to flap
- ⚠️ The game is extremly flickery

### 2. DodgeDot

Move left and right to dodge falling obstacles.

- Controls: Left and Right arrow keys

## 🧰 Platform

Designed for the [NumWorks calculator](https://www.numworks.com/) using the built-in Python app. No external libraries required.

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Go to the [NumWorks Python Workshop](https://workshop.numworks.com/python) with a WebUSB compatible browser (Use Chrome)
2. Open one of the `.py` files from this repo.
3. Copy the code and paste it into the online editor.
4. Run it on the web or send it to your calculator.
⚠️ The emulator is very laggy. Works better on a real calculator.
